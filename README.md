# Glowing-Plant
Let's creat a cute bouquet of flowers?

Hey guys! I'm going to tell you a little step by step how I made this brilliant plant, okay?

If you want to see the finished work, just access this link to take a look. (https://codepen.io/Vicky-the-looper/full/WNmvvgo)

Step by step:

1- I opened VScode and created 3 files:

> index.html

> style.css

> index.js

2- In index.html I placed the entire organization of what the flower would look like and the background as well

3- In style.css I have already added the animation of the flower as well as the animation of the components, leaves and sparkles, along with the color of all of them.

4 - In index.js I entered the duration of the animation, in this case the animation reset time

5- I opened CodPen and placed the files separately and tcharan!! It worked.
